# EC1151 - Statistics

This course was taught by me (Vitor Hadad) during the Spring of 2016 and Fall 2017 at Boston College.

This was a somewhat experimental class, in which I decided to spend the first half of the quarter making sure that students properly understood probability theory. In addition, I also taught python programming and had students run simple simulations in order to gain intuition.
